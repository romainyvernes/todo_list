## Todo List
### Description
Keep track of your busy schedule in one place, from any device.
### Instructions
Start by logging in with your Google account, create a new project (e.g., home, work, school), and add a new corresponding task for every event you want to remember. Assign your task a name, an optional due date, and a priority level. Any task can be modified if needed at any time. All tasks are accessible in one place, or by project only. Tasks that include a due date are automatically listed in the "Today" or "Next 7 days" sections when applicable. And by default, tasks are always listed by due date (if any) and by priority level to ensure that a task with a closer due date and a higher priority level comes first. When a task is completed, simply click on the blank circle next to its name to delete it. Once you've decided a project is no longer needed, click on the trash icon next to its name in left-hand side panel to delete it, along with all the tasks it may contain. When you're done using the app, you may log out knowing that all your tasks and projects are safely stored to be retrieved on your next visit.
